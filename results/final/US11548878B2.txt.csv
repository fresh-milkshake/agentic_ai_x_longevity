11,Compound A,EBP,binding,"The binding ability of Compound A to EBP was examined. The test was carried out in accordance with Receptor Signal Transduction Protocols, pp. 135-164 (ISBN 978-1-61779-125-3).",,,,
11,Compound A,EBP,binding,"A membrane fraction was collected from sigma-1 receptor-deficient human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells, in which EBP was deleted or was overexpressed.",,,,
11,Compound A,EBP,binding,"The receptor binding test method is as follows. A membrane fraction of individual cells (21.7 to 120 ug/well) and the tritium-labeled Compound A (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.1, 6.3, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0 or 100.0 nM) were added to a 96-well plate, and incubation was then carried out at 37° C. for 2 hours (Total binding).",,,,
11,Compound A,EBP,binding,"As a control, the trittum-labeled Compound A (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.1, 6.3, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0 or 100.0 nM) and the 100 uM non-labeled Compound A were added to a membrane fraction of individual cells, and incubation was then carried out in the same manner as described above (Non-specific binding).",,,,
12,Compound A,EBP,binding,The specific binding ability of Compound A to EBP was determined by subtracting the radiation dose of the control (1 (Non-specific binding) from the radiation dose derived from tritium-labeled Compound A at each concentration (Total binding).,,,,
12,Compound A,EBP,high affinity binding,"From these results, it became clear that Compound A has high affinity for EBP.",,,,
